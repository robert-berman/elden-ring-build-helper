# Elden Ring Build Helper

Hi All! I made this app to help out the Elden Ring community in their process of finding the right weapon to progress through the game with. To use this, you'll have to sign up for an account first. Then, you can navigate to create a character where you can input your stats. Once you've completed those steps, navigate to the weapons view and select the weapon you'd like to compare your stats to! If your stats aren't compatible, you'll recieve information on what you need to add some points to.

Update : Wed, Mar 30th

The app is now successfully deployed and you can use this at https://elden-ring-build-helper.herokuapp.com/ 

Please let me know if you have any suggestions or potential features as i'd love to discuss.
